Lighttpd: is a web server designed to be fast, secure, flexible, 
and standards-compliant. It is optimized for environments where speed
is a top priority because it consumes less CPU and RAM than other servers.

Installation of Lighttpd packages.
sudo apt install lighttpd

We allow connections through port 80 with the command:
sudo ufw allow 80

We check that we have actually allowed it. Port 80 and allow should appear:
sudo ufw status

We add the rule that includes port 80.
If you don't remember how to add rules in port forwarding.
Machine configuration → Network → Port forwarding → Replicate the capture
