WordPress: It is a content management system focused on the creation of any type of website.

To install the latest version of WordPress we must first install wget and zip. To do this we will use the following command:
sudo apt install wget zip
wget: It is a command line tool used to download files from the web.

zip: It is a command line utility for compressing and decompressing files in ZIP format.

Once we have installed the packages we must locate ourselves in the folder /var/www/ with the command cd we will access it:

Copy
cd /var/www/
Once we are in the path /var/www/ we must download the latest version of WordPress.
As my native language is Spanish I will select the latest version in Spanish. We will use the following command:
sudo wget https://es.wordpress.org/latest-es_ES.zip
I could be https://fr.wordpress.org/latest-fr_FR.zip

Unzip the file you just downloaded with the command:
sudo unzip latest-en_US.zip

We will rename the folder html and call it html_old:
sudo mv html/ html_old/

Now we will rename the wordpress folder and call it html:
sudo mv wordpress/ html

Finally we will set these permissions on the html folder. We will use the command sudo chmod -R 755 html.
The number 7 indicates that the owner has read, write and execute permissions.
The number 5 indicates that the group and others only have read and execute permissions.
sudo chmod -R 755 html
